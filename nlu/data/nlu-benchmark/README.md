# Natural Language Understanding benchmark

This repository contains the results of two benchmarks that compare natural language understanding services offering:
1. **built-in intents** (Apple’s SiriKit, Amazon’s Alexa, Microsoft’s Luis, Google’s API.ai, and Snips’ SDK) for the intents covered by the [Snips SDK](https://sdk.snips.ai/). This benchmark was performed in December 2016. Its results are described in length in the [following post](
https://snips.ai/content/sdk-benchmark-visualisation/).
2. **custom intent engines** (Google's API.ai, Facebook's Wit, Microsoft's Luis, Amazon's Alexa, and Snips' NLU) for seven chosen intents. This benchmark was performed in June 2017. Its results are described in the [following post](https://medium.com/@alicecoucke/benchmarking-natural-language-understanding-systems-google-facebook-microsoft-and-snips-2b8ddcf9fb19).

The data is provided for each benchmark and more details about the methods are available in the README file in each folder.
